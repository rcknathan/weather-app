# Weather App
<p>React application of a weather and weather application.</p>
<p>It uses the free weather-api REST API, which can be visited <a href="https://github.com/robertoduessmann/weather-api?tab=readme-ov-file">here</a>.</p>
<p>The application allows the user to enter any city and obtain basic information fed by the API.</p>
<p>Temperature, Wind and Situation are the information that can be viewed.</p>

<h2 style="color: #f00;">Notice!</h2>
<p>This project was done solely with the intention of studying and improving my knowledge in React (which includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript).</p>
<p>As it is a free API and a study application, instabilities or small unexpected errors may occur during its execution.</p>
